---

# Overview

 Lightning Connect lets you seamlessly access data from external sources, side-by-side with your Salesforce data. You can pull data from legacy systems such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle in real time, without making a copy of the data in Salesforce. And its all easily configured by a simple yet powerful point and click interface.

* Connect and access data from external sources with point and click simplicity
* Dramatically reduce integration time to unlock and modernize back-office systems such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft and more
* View external data side-by-side with existing Salesforce objects


  Lightning connect allows you connect to the data that is otherwise locked away behind complex system integration projects.
  
  Lightning connet gives you a lightweight and simple way to access data using the oData protocol, a REST based standard for accessing data from anywhere.

- unlock your back office data with Lightning connect - simple & effective way to use data from your entire company without expensive system integration projects

- make use of ever increasing public data (weather & traffic info for teams out on the road) and create innovative apps that helps everyone in the business be more effective and collaborate

Old-style batch integration is no match for the demands of our always-on digital world. Salesforce Lightning Connect goes native with real-time connection.


It will allow you to store the data off platform but utilise a special kind of Custom Object to view it.


Track and represent data from sources outside Salesforce by creating external objects. Each external object maps to a table in a data source outside Salesforce, such as SharePoint®, and allows you to set up access to its data from search and custom tabs in Salesforce. Each external object relies on the connection details stored in an external data source definition.

## Managing External Data Sources

Define external data sources to manage connections with data sources outside of Salesforce, such as SharePoint®. An external data source definition contains connection and authentication information to access external data. Once an external data source is set up, its visible content is mapped to external object definitions to enable searching for external data in Salesforce.

## Data Integrations

Salesforce offers a rich library of programmatic and declarative integration tools to implement business logic spanning multiple application systems.

### LIGHTNING CONNECT
Use data from any external data source in real time with any application you create on the Salesforce1 Platform. Instead of spending months integrating legacy systems, you can easily connect and access data in real time to incorporate that data into any application.

### HEROKU CONNECT
Easily sync data between your Heroku customer apps and your Force.com employee apps. Loyalty apps, buying experience apps, marketing campaign apps, and Internet of Things apps are among the many use cases where Heroku Connect delivers the customer experience you want, with all of the data going back to your employee-facing applications.

## OData sources & partners
Obviously, not every data source supports OData natively. Which is why Salesforce is pushing on an ecosystem drive that brings partners like Informatica, Jitterbit, MuleSoft, Progress Software, SnapLogic and SoftwareAG into the jamboree. Those guys have built their businesses on helping customers move enterprise data around between systems and delivery models; with some friendly peer pressure from Salesforce, they now support OData and Lightning Connect.

IT organizations spend less time worrying about how to get all their data into Salesforce and more time just doing it. In turn, workers at those organizations will be able to do things like check inventory data from within the Salesforce1 mobile app for potentially the first time ever.  That's going to be the sales pitch for Salesforce as it continues to go after bigger companies.

Large enterprises are definitely the target demographic for Salesforce1 Lightning Connect: With subscriptions starting at $4,000  a month, depending on the number of data sources
