Welcome to the AgileForce website, a place to learn how to create apps on the Salesforce1 Platform using Agile principles and practices.

The Salesforce1 Platform is developed in an agile mannor by the teams at Salesforce, using a mixture of practices from Scrum and Lean software development.  We will share some of the specific practices of those teams with you, to demonstrate how we create a platform you can trust.

This site will be a mixture of articles, tutorials and workshops to help you on your journey with the Salesforce1 Platform.

Thank you
The AgileForce Team
