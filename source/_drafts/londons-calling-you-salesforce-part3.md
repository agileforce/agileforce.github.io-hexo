Continuing my [London's Calling](http://www.londonscalling.net) live blogging we move onto careers within the Salesforce community.  Its never been a better time to have Salesforce skills or start learning those skills as there are so many opportunities out there.  It takes all sorts of people and talents to make the Salesforce community the success it has become already and there are many different roles & industries you can get involved in.

There are big opportunities for exciting careers, but the array of choice can make navigating “what next” a bit bewildering. If you’re at a decision point in your career, or just looking for inspiration on new avenues then where do you start?

# Careers for all

* [Salesforce’s calling – where can your Salesforce career take you?](http://www.londonscalling.net/sessions/salesforces-calling-where-can-your-salesforce-career-take-you/) by [Mary Youngs](https://twitter.com/maryyoungs) in Ctrl room 

[Mary Youngs](https://twitter.com/maryyoungs) assembled a panel of experts from the community, who have all navigated different routes through the Salesforce world.  The panel all had different views on job market trends and shared their thoughts and experiences.

## Mary Youngs
The ... of CloudSherpas ..
In Salesforce there is a phenomenal network of people to help you find a new role & also advise you about a specific role or their experiences with a particular company.  The community is very open and willing to share their views on everyone in the community.

Mary: keeping up to date: industry knowledge - how do companies share and pair that knowlege with more technical skills

## Luke Emberton - Cloudsherpas CTA, Director of Technology
previous development in .Net
came from a CRM background with other products then got introduced 
salesforce was new and there was a lot of work to do but lots of opportunities and Luke carved a path to become a certified technical architecture


## Anup Jadhav
Works for Startups and is a Salesforce MVP.  Anup has a background in Java development and when he first looked at Salesforce many years ago did not file it appealing, at that time there were only S-Controls.  When Apex was released the platform became much more attractive and Anup quickly gained an appreciation of the platform and what it allowed him to do. 

When Anup is looking for a new role, one of the main things he considers is how much impact he cam make in that role.  He is also excited about the further developments of Lightning and the possibilities the new Thunder IoT cloud.

## Rich Law,
A consultant with Cloud Sherpas, speciallising in Charity & the not for profit sector.
supporting a seibel system and had an interest in CRM with a final project in that job to upgrade Siebel so they could use the latest version of IE, which was technically very involved with was a horrible experience.  Then Rich started hearing about Salesforce and the seamless 3 updates a year that ment he could just get on with business

got involved in the charit / not for profit (track animals, ), free licences, promoting STEM careers for girls, tracking a whole lifetime of career to see what directions they end up taking.  This feeds back into the process and hopefully improves it for all


## Alex Wallwork
is an admin & consultant who sees salesforce as a very empowering tool to help admins make the business even more productive.  Admins have a vital understanding of the business and can be an invaluable contributor to the way the business runs.  It would be great to have more recongintion of the role admins play.


## Is Admin too low level a name

There was in interesting question from the audience asking if we should stop calling ourselves admins, when really we are business analysts.  Admins spend much of their time advising the business how the rest of the employees can use Salesforce to be more productive.

Mary Youngs commented that she is interested in establishing a greater respect for the admin role and said that changing the name we use is a great step.  Mary see the role as a valuable business partner.  She would also like to see more work done on collecting metrics and interpreting that data to visualise just how much more effective the business is due to the work of admins.
