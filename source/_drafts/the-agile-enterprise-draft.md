Becoming an agile organisation is not easy as although coding is much more accessible today the actual build, deployment and maintence of software has many challenges.

Thankfully, many tools and platforms have evolved to help organisations boost their productivity and get software out to their customers quickly.  Although tools are not the silver bullet, understanding how to make the most of the tools available returns a lot of value.


# Data Driven approach 

Businesses revolve around the data they have and being able to turn that data into relevant information.  Without easily accessible and relevant information the organisation misses out on opportunities for business and is less likely to service the needs of their clients.

The Salesforce1 Platform has a data centric approach, allowing easy creationi of an object model of the business to be created all with clicks rather than code.  This easy creation of the object model means that many more roles can give input directly into the creation of the model.  So CEO's, business analysts, customer facing roles can all easily define the type of data they want to capture and work with.  

The ability for other roles to define and even create object models for the busines reduces the burdon of software developers, allowing them to focus their skills and experiences on more compuationally challenging issues.

# Shared skills

When organiations focus on a common platform it enables the sharing of skills and experiences much more readily.  When most of your apps are built in the same way, with the same technology, then building those apps quickly becomes highly effective.

Using the Salesforce1 Platform, the learning curve for getting web and mobile apps deployed is very shallow.  Everything you build on the Salesforce1 Platform is available via the freely available Salesforce1 mobile app.

Naturally, not everything will be build with one technology stack.  However, if 80% of the apps you build are build on one stack and it becomes a very lean development process then you have much more time and resources for the more challenging 20%

# Standard repeatable process 

With most of your app development being on one platform, it is much easier to construct an effective process for creating, packaing and deploying those apps.  By creating a highly automated and transparent process, the introduction of human errors is drastically reduced.

In the Salesforce1 Platform you can .....


# Reconsiling applications

Once organisations get to a certain size they find there is a myriad of applications supporting the business, spread around different platforms and technologies.  Whilst there are edge cases for some business activities to use specific technology, by rationalising on a common platform your software development and maintenace can be much more effective.
