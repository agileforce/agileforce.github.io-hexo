[London's Calling](http://www.londonscalling.net) to all the far away towns & cities of the UK for the last few months and the Salesforce community answered that call, turning up in their hundreds.

So today I have been surrounded by many of the brightest and best minds in the UK and across Europe & the Middle East too.

Here is what I discovered today in several parts:

* Part 1: Getting Agile with Salesforce & Testing
* Part 2: A career of fun & discovery
* Part 3: Lightning to the Salesforce nation

# Getting Agile with Salesforce & Testing

{% img img-topic /images/tdd-circle-of-life.png %}

* [Test Driven Development (TDD) in Apex & why you should be using it](http://www.londonscalling.net/sessions/test-driven-development-in-apex-and-why-you-should-be-using-it/) by [Chris Aldridge - @CAldridg3](https://twitter.com/CAldridg3) in **Tab room**

----Rewrite - from Chris
Developers and engineers in almost every major programming language are flocking towards Test Driven Development. The practice is prevalent in Java, .Net, Ruby, Swift, C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Javascript, and dozens of other languages.

By embracing TDD, not only will you never have to worry about that 75% code coverage again, you will also write much better code, and in much less time. If you’ve ever had to pull a junior developer onto your project to raise your unit test coverage for a release, then this is the talk for you!

We’ll discuss the benefits of adopting TDD within your team before applying a TDD approach to some coding problems. Along the way, we’ll discuss methods for applying TDD, best practices, anti-patterns and dive into some more advanced concepts which go hand-in-hand with the process.

* [Writing sustainable and maintainable Apex Tests](http://www.londonscalling.net/sessions/writing-sustainable-and-maintainable-apex-tests/) by [Simon Lawrence - @srlawr](https://twitter.com/srlawr) of [Desynit](https://twitter.com/desynit) - **1.30 Alt room**


----Rewrite - from Simon
Writing tests is easy, writing good tests is harder, and writing tests that themselves will stand the test of time is a true skill! This session will cover the common pitfalls of writing quality Apex tests, designed to survive the turbulence of the cloud. If you more often than not find yourself losing time revisiting and repairing legacy test coverage, this is the session for you.

> Also take a look at [Writing True Unit Tests using Dependency Injection and Mocking in Apex](https://adtennant.co.uk/blog/2016/01/25/writing-true-unit-tests-using-dependency-injection-mocking-apex/) by [Alex Tennant](https://twitter.com/adtennant)


* [Unit tests - they’re not just for Apex!]() by [Keir Bowden - @bobbuzard](https://twitter.com/bob_buzzard), CTO of [BrightGen]()

With the advent of client side component frameworks, more and more business logic is making its way into front end JavaScript, and this requires testing just as much as server side code.

In this session attendees will learn how to build unit tests for their Visualforce and Lightning JavaScript code, and see JavaScript unit tests in action on a sample application.


# Lightning assembly - App Builder

{% img img-topic /images/salesforce-lightning-app-builder-devices.png %}

Lightning is the modern way to build Salesforce apps and Barry Hughes did an excellent job of showing just how quick lightning is.  Its not called Lightning for nothing, after all!

Taking an existing Visualforce single page app, Barry walked us step by step in rebuilding that app using Lightning.

## Lightning Style - design system

{% img img-topic /images/salesforce-lightning-experience-multi-device.png %}

Fabien showed how we can all use the beautiful and delightful Salesforce Lightning Experience design in our own apps...

----Rewrite
Salesforce recently unveiled Lightning Experience, the next step of it’s evolution. This includes a whole new and beautiful UI, but with this comes a new question: How can we create applications that match this new look & feel? Come see how to use Lightning Design System inside your application, no matter what technology you’re using: VisualForce, Lightning Component or even outside of Salesforce!

# Lightning Power - Components

{% img img-topic /images/trailhead_module_lightning_components.png %}

The power that allows you to build Lightning Apps so fast are the Lightning components.

----Rewrite
Maybe you’ve done the Lightning Component Trailheads or perhaps you’ve read the developer guide? If so you’ve probably started to scratch the surface of various advanced programming concepts such as component facets, passing functions as parameters or dynamic creation of components or event handlers? Or maybe this is the first you’ve heard and you’re curious to see what’s possible? Either way, if you’d like to know more this session is for you!

Over the course of 30 minutes I’ll walk you through these concepts and by example show you how and more importantly why you want to use them to build awesome Lightning components.
